    <h3>Winter Morning</h3>
    <div>
        I love winter mornings! Sleep in a bit later, watch the frosty sunshine peek through your window, and relax in the cozy warmth of your blankets. The world outside looks soft and quiet, blanketed in a fresh layer of frost. The trees may have bare branches, but their leaves stay green, waiting for spring.

        In the countryside, people wake up to the delicious smell of yummy cakes baking in the oven. They gather around the warm fire, sharing stories and laughter with family and friends, enjoying the warmth and delicious treats. Winter mornings are happy, cozy, and a time for togetherness. Everyone enjoys them in their own way!
